# Employee Salary Range Predictor

## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict optimal employee salary ranges based on various demographic and employment-related factors. The goal is to assist Human Resources departments in ensuring fair, competitive, and equitable compensation structures, identifying potential pay disparities, and aiding in data-driven salary negotiations and workforce budgeting.

## Problem Statement

In today's dynamic labor market, ensuring fair and competitive compensation is critical for employee satisfaction, retention, and organizational success. This project addresses the challenge of establishing optimal salary ranges by leveraging historical data to predict whether an individual's salary falls below or above a certain threshold (e.g., `<=50K` or `>50K`). The model aims to provide insights for HR professionals to make informed decisions, promote pay equity, and align compensation strategies with market benchmarks.

## Features

* **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes an XGBoost Classifier for high-performance salary range prediction.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Employs `MinMaxScaler` for numerical feature scaling and `LabelEncoder` for handling categorical features.
* **Interactive Web Application:** Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive user interface for real-time predictions.
* **Modular Design:** Separates model training (Jupyter Notebook) from deployment (Streamlit app) and stores pre-trained assets.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sanj64/Employee-Salary-Analysis.git](https://github.com/sanj64/Employee-Salary-Analysis.git)
    cd Employee-Salary-Analysis # navigate to the root directory
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Model Training and Asset Generation

The machine learning model and pre-processing assets (`.pkl` files) are generated by running the Jupyter Notebook.

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Open `employee_salary_analysis.ipynb`** in your browser.
3.  **Run all cells** in the notebook from top to bottom. This will:
    * Load and preprocess the `adult.csv` dataset.
    * Train the XGBoost model.
    * Fit and save the `MinMaxScaler`, `LabelEncoder` for `income`, and individual `LabelEncoder`s for all categorical input features into the `models/` directory.

## How to Run the Streamlit Application

After generating the model assets, you can launch the interactive web application:

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2.  **Navigate to the root directory of your project.**
3.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app/app.py
    ```
4.  The application will open in your default web browser. If not, Streamlit will provide a local URL.

## Usage

In the Streamlit application, you will find various input fields corresponding to the features used by the model. Adjust these values (e.g., Age, Workclass, Occupation, Hours per Week) and click the "Predict Salary Range" button to get the model's prediction on whether the individual's salary will be `<=50K` or `>50K`.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the [Adult Income Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income/data), publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains data extracted from the 1994 Census database.
